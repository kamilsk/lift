## üí° Idea

```bash
$ lift call && lift up
```

A full description of the idea is available [here][design.page].

## üèÜ Motivation

In [Avito](https://tech.avito.ru) we have an excellent [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)
which helps us to run our services in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) clusters with just a few commands.
But I want to run it so quickly and frequently as possible to debug during development.
For that reason, I need a possibility to up services written on [Go](https://golang.org) locally from IDE like
[GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) without losing the benefits that
[minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) provides.

## ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to

...rethinking

## üß© Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
$ brew install kamilsk/tap/lift
```

### Binary

```bash
$ curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamilsk/lift/master/bin/install | sh
# or
$ wget -qO-  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamilsk/lift/master/bin/install | sh
```

> Don't forget about [security](https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2016/04/detecting-curl-pipe-bash-server-side/).

### Source

```bash
# use standard go tools
$ go get github.com/kamilsk/lift@latest
# or use egg tool
$ egg tools add github.com/kamilsk/lift@latest
```

> [egg][] is an `extended go get`.

### Bash and Zsh completions

```bash
$ lift completion bash > /path/to/bash_completion.d/lift.sh
$ lift completion zsh  > /path/to/zsh-completions/_lift.zsh
# or autodetect
$ source <(lift completion)
```

> See `kubectl` [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#enabling-shell-autocompletion).
