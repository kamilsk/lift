## Motivation

In [Avito](https://tech.avito.ru) we have an excellent PaaS which helps us to run our services in Kubernetes clusters
with just a few commands. But I want to run it so quickly and frequently as possible to debug during development.
For that reason, I need a possibility to up services written on Go locally from IDE like **GoLand** without losing
the benefits that [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) provides.

## The concept

```bash
$ lift env > .env

$ eval $(lift up)
```

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
$ brew install kamilsk/tap/lift
```

### Binary

```bash
$ REQ_VER=0.0.2  # all available versions are on https://github.com/kamilsk/lift/releases/
$ REQ_OS=Linux   # macOS is also available
$ REQ_ARCH=64bit # 32bit is also available
# wget -q -O lift.tar.gz
$ curl -sL -o lift.tar.gz \
       https://github.com/kamilsk/lift/releases/download/"${REQ_VER}/lift_${REQ_VER}_${REQ_OS}-${REQ_ARCH}".tar.gz
$ tar xf lift.tar.gz -C "${GOPATH}"/bin/ && rm lift.tar.gz
```
